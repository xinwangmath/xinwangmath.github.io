This is a personal blog, mostly about notes on mathematics and related stuffs.

I am Xin Wang. I am currently a graduate student in mathematics at Georgia Tech, with a second major in computational science and engineering. 

I am currently working on numerical analysis. I am interested in numerical analysis, application of real algebraic geometry in optimization and topological data analysis.
