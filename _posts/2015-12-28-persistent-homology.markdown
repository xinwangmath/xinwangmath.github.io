title:  "Persistent Homology"
---

This is a set of learning notes on persistent homology.

Persistent homology is a method in topological data analysis. It views the date set(refered as a data point cloud) as a geometric object, and extracts topological information (homology groups) of the set. We first review the main idea of homology and persistence, and then briefly discuss a few applications of persistent homology.
